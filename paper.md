# Statement of Need

<!--
Describing why this material is beneficial to the community, why someone else would use it
-->

In traditional undergraduate biology education, students learn coding skills and biology concepts separately. This course, designed for third and fourth-year undergraduate students, fosters R coding skills in the context of learning statistics and ecology. Notably, the materials cover statistical concepts that are broadly useful in biology: linear regression, mixed effects models, randomization tests, principal component analyses, ANOVA and MANOVA, model selection, and numerically solving differential equations. We delivered these materials as a four month course, but these concepts are presented in stand-alone lectures designed by an interdisciplinary teaching team that could easily be mixed and matched to suit any desired course outcomes. The course is completely interactive: all lectures are designed to be delivered in a participatory live-coding format so that students learn experientally in real-time. The course materials also include assignments matched to lecture materials that sharpen students' understanding and allow them to critically apply their skills to new problems. Reproducible research skills are emphasized throughout, and the course culminates in an open-ended, self-directed project that allows students to apply their skills to real ecological data. The course repository is linked to an auto-generated website that presents the syllabus and materials and is easily modified by editing the course files on GitHub.

Bullet point version (can be removed after discussion):

* Students often learn coding skills and biology concepts separately, while this course fosters R coding skills in the context of learning statistics and ecology.
* Course contains stand-alone lectures that outline broadly useful statistical methods.
* Modular: lectures can be mixed and matched
* This course is completely interactive: all lectures are designed to be delivered in a participatory live-coding format so that students learn experientally in real-time.
* This course contains assignments that sharpen students' understanding and allow them to critically apply skills to new problems.  
* Students learn creativity and critical thinking through an open-ended, self-directed project that uses real ecological data.
* Students learn skills for reproducible research throughout the course.
* Course website - nice looking and easy to use
* We have taught this course twice and have refined the materials based on previous teaching experience
