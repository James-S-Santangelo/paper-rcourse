# Statement of Need

# Main Body

## learning objectives and content
The overarching objective of the course is to teach quantitative research
methods that are reproducible and collaborative. Each lecture is independent and
have specific learning objectives. First lecture starts with giving students an
overview of the capabilities of R such as more efficient quantitative analysis
of data compared to manual handling of spreadsheets, programming in R, and
integrating analyses with generating reports using R Notebook (markdown syntax).
Second lecture introduces fundamental elements in programming with R such as
vectors, data frames, basic operations and use of functions. The third lecture
intorduces the concept of exploratory analysis of datasets with a focus on using
dplyr package. The objective for lecture four is to learn the advantage of using
summary statistics and data visualization using tidyverse packages. Lecture five
focuses on approaches for cleaning up and preprocessing of raw data. Lecture
seven introduces basic descriptive and inferential statistical techniques such
as linear models. Lecture eight focuses on linear mixed effects models to
analyze the fixed and random effects in nested exploratory data. Lecture nine
introduces randomization tests and teaches simulating datasets and applying such
tests on simulated and read data. Lecture ten's objective is to learn
multivariate statistics with a focus on principle component analysis and
multivariate analysis of variance. Lecture eleven introduces model selection
approach, its benefits over traditional inferential statistics, and model
selection criteria such as Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion. Lecture twelve is to
learn population models and using of differential equations such to analyze
system dynamics. Lecture thirteen focuses on time series data and fitting
numerical models to such datasets. Lecture fourteen introduces the necessity to
acquire a scientific approach, the steps involved and integrating such approach
with group dynamics and in assigning roles and tasks. In this lecture students
form groups for the final course project. Lecture fifteen focuses on
reproducible and collaborative research tools such as Git version control and
Github platform. Each project group make their Github repository and the team
members learn the basics of documenting the progress of the project and
collaborate using these tools. Lecture sixteen, finishes the course with the
topic of reproducibility. We learn the barriers, and the beneficial approaches
such as the use of metadata and generating comprehensive manuscript in
R-markdown.
